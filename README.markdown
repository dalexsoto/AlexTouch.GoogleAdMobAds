WARNING!!
=========

This code is outdated it is just here for [Hysterical reasons](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hysterical-reasons.html), Please use [the one on monotouch-bindings repo](https://github.com/mono/monotouch-bindings/tree/master/GoogleAdMobAds) instead.


AlexTouch.GoogleAdMobAds
========================

This is a MonoTouch Binding for Google's AdMob library `Version 6.2.0`

You just need to download the project, Open it with MonoDevelop, build project and add the resulting AlexTouch.GoogleAdMobAds.dll to your MonoTouch project (This DLL will be located in /AlexTouch.GoogleAdMobAds/bin/<DEBUG|RELEASE>/AlexTouch.GoogleAdMobAds.dll).

Once referenced in your MonoTouch project add the following using statement to your source file.

			using AlexTouch.GoogleAdMobAds;

Also it uses the c# events =) so Have Fun!!
			
			var ad = new GADBannerView(GADAdSizeCons.MediumRectangle,new PointF(0,0))
			{
				AdUnitID = "Use Your AdMob Id here",
				RootViewController = this //or your RootViewController	
			};
			
			ad.DidReceiveAd += delegate 
			{
				this.View.AddSubview(ad);
				Console.WriteLine("AD Received");
			};
			
			ad.DidFailToReceiveAdWithError += delegate(object sender, GADBannerViewDidFailWithErrorEventArgs e) {
				Console.WriteLine(e.Error);
			};
			
			ad.WillPresentScreen += delegate {
				Console.WriteLine("showing new screen");
			};
			
			ad.WillLeaveApplication += delegate {
				Console.WriteLine("I will leave application");
			};
			
			ad.WillDismissScreen += delegate {
				Console.WriteLine("Dismissing opened screen");
			};
			
			Console.Write("Requesting Ad");
			ad.LoadRequest(new GADRequest());
